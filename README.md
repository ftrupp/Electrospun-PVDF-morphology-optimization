The script included in this repository is the Final Graded Assignment of the Introduction to Machine Learning course by UNSAM. 
I leveraged the tools learned in the course to solve an important issue regarding my PhD research as an experimental physicist: the optimization of the morphology of PVDF electrospun fibers.
This script was the seed project that later lead to a scientific paper published in the Journal of Industrial Textiles, by the name: 
"Poly(vinylidene fluoride) electrospun nonwovens morphology: Prediction and optimization of the size and number of beads on fibers through response surface methodology and machine learning regressions".

IMPORTANT NOTE: This is not the final script used to obtain the results shown in the article.
